Device Management
Device Management is an operating system function that manages all of the devices attached to the computer.
This includes all physical hardware, such as keyboard, mouse, monitor, hard drives, GPU, ect. 
Device management will notify the other operating system functions when changes are made to hardware, such as a USB being inserted into a port. 
It will also allow the other operating system functions to make changes to connected devices, such as writing to a HDD, or changing what a monitor shows.
